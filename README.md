# Intro-to-Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.  The goal of the class will be to learn how to create custom brushes, designing first on paper, and thinking about the set of rules that can help us achieve our design. Over the coarse of the class we will also explore topics such as randomness, movement, scenes, and interface design with control p5. We will be looking to finish a complete sketch that can be used as the start of a new project, a finished piece, or an element of a future performance.

Introduction & Past Projects

What is the overall project for the day?
Designing your Own Brushes & Drawing Program

**Why build your own tools?**

- As technology enters more and more into our lives, we need to become technologically literate and be able to define the usage of new technologies
- When technologies are newly born, they are very impressionable, and often the early usage may define it's usage in the future
- I think that we have seen this in the first iteration of the internet

**We comply with someone elses thinking**

- This might be okay sometimes, but other times you want the tool to comply with your own thinking, or maybe you want it to solve a problem that other tools out there do not solve
- The choice of using someone else tool, versus your own, becomes part of the artistic decision making process
- You assess what you are looking to achieve, and decide what is the correct path
  - Quick Ideas, Pencile and Paper
  - On the go painting, ipad with apple pencil
  - Algorithmic & generative forms, programming
- Designing the tool is really working at the most granular level of art making, which is starting with the material itself
