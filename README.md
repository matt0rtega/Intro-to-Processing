# Intro-to-Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. For anyone who was here for the p5.js intro at the beginning of camp, this will go over similar topics but reviewing the differences between p5.js and Processing, advantages and disadvantages. The goal of the class will be to learn how to create custom brushes, designing first on paper, and thinking about the set of rules that can help us achieve our design.
