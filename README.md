# Intro-to-Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.  The goal of the class will be to learn how to create custom brushes, designing first on paper, and thinking about the set of rules that can help us achieve our design. Over the coarse of the class we will also explore topics such as randomness, movement, scenes, and interface design with control p5. We will be looking to finish a complete sketch that can be used as the start of a new project, a finished piece, or an element of a future performance.
